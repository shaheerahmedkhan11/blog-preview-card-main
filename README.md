## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a responsive blog preview card using CSS Flexbox and media queries. The main challenge was ensuring the layout adapts well across different screen sizes.

```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  main {
    width: 95%;
    padding: 1rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my CSS skills, especially with animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
